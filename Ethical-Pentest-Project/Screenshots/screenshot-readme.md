# 📸 Screenshots Documentation

This directory contains screenshots captured during the ethical penetration testing lab. These images serve as **visual evidence** to support findings documented in the penetration test report and vulnerability analysis.

All screenshots were taken in a controlled lab environment on systems owned or explicitly authorized for testing.

## 📁 Screenshot Categories

### 🔍 Reconnaissance & Scanning

Screenshots showing initial discovery and enumeration activities.

* Network scans (Nmap)
* Service and version detection
* Open ports and exposed services

**Example filenames:**

* `nmap-initial-scan.png`
* `nmap-service-enum.png`

---

### 🧭 Enumeration

Screenshots demonstrating deeper inspection of services and systems.

* Web directory enumeration
* SMB/FTP enumeration
* User and permission discovery

**Example filenames:**

* `gobuster-directories.png`
* `ftp-anon-access.png`

---

### ⚠️ Vulnerability Identification

Evidence of identified vulnerabilities prior to exploitation.

* Misconfigurations
* Outdated software versions
* Weak permissions or credentials

**Example filenames:**

* `vulnerable-vsftpd-version.png`
* `weak-file-permissions.png`

---

### 💥 Exploitation

Screenshots capturing successful exploitation steps.

* Metasploit sessions
* Exploit execution
* Reverse shells

**Example filenames:**

* `metasploit-exploit-success.png`
* `reverse-shell-established.png`

---

### 👑 Privilege Escalation

Evidence showing escalation from a low-privilege user to root/administrator.

* `whoami` verification
* `id` command output
* Root shell confirmation

**Example filenames:**

* `id-command-root.png`
* `root-shell-confirmed.png`

---

### 🔐 Post-Exploitation

Screenshots showing impact and access level after compromise.

* Sensitive file access
* Proof-of-concept data exposure

**Example filenames:**

* `shadow-file-access.png`
* `post-exploitation-proof.png`

---

## 📝 Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens:

```
<phase>-<description>.png
```

**Good example:**

```
priv-esc-root-shell.png
```
