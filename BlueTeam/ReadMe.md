## Blue Team Project Summary

This portfolio demonstrates hands-on **Blue Team cybersecurity skills** focused on monitoring, detection, investigation, and response within simulated enterprise environments. The projects emphasize how defensive security teams identify threats, analyze malicious activity, and improve security posture through logging, alerting, and hardening.

Across these projects, I implement centralized logging, create and tune SIEM detections, investigate security events, and document incident response procedures. The work reflects real-world SOC operations, including endpoint monitoring, Active Directory security, threat intelligence mapping, vulnerability prioritization, and defensive strategy development.

All projects prioritize practical detection logic, clear documentation, and actionable remediation recommendations to mirror how security teams operate in production environments.
