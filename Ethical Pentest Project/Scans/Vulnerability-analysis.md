# Vulnerability Analysis

## Internal Network Penetration Test

---

## Purpose

This document provides a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities identified during the internal penetration test. Each finding includes technical details, risk severity, potential impact, and exploitability to support informed remediation decisions.

Severity ratings are based on **CVSS v3.1** and contextual risk within an internal network environment.

## V-01: Backdoored FTP Service (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

### Description

The target system was running **vsFTPd version 2.3.4**, which is known to contain a malicious backdoor. This backdoor allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain shell access by sending a crafted username during the authentication process.

### Affected System

* Metasploitable2 Linux Server

### Technical Details

* **Service:** FTP
* **Port:** 21/TCP
* **CVE:** CVE-2011-2523
* **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 10.0 (Critical)

### Impact

Successful exploitation results in **immediate root-level access**, granting full control of the operating system. An attacker could read or modify sensitive files, install malware, establish persistence, and pivot to other internal systems.

### Exploitability

* Public exploit available
* Exploitable without authentication
* Reliable exploitation via Metasploit

### Evidence

* Successful remote shell obtained
* `id` command confirmed UID 0 (root)

### Recommendation

* Remove the vulnerable FTP service immediately
* Replace with a secure, supported alternative
* Apply vendor patches and updates
* Ensure services run under least-privileged accounts

## V-02: Unrestricted Network Services

### Description

Multiple unnecessary services were exposed on the internal network without access restrictions. These services increase the attack surface and provide additional vectors for enumeration and exploitation.

### Affected Systems

* Metasploitable2 Linux Server
* Ubuntu Server

### Technical Details

* Multiple open TCP ports
* No host-based firewall restrictions observed

### Impact

Exposed services allow attackers to gather system information, enumerate users, and identify vulnerable software versions. This significantly increases the likelihood of successful compromise.

### Exploitability

* Easily discoverable via network scanning
* Enables chained attacks

### Recommendation

* Disable unused services
* Implement host-based firewall rules
* Restrict access to required ports only

---

## V-03: Outdated Web Server Software

### Description

The web server software identified during scanning was outdated and potentially vulnerable to known exploits and misconfigurations.

### Affected System

* Metasploitable2 Linux Server

### Technical Details

* **Service:** Apache HTTP Server
* **Port:** 80/TCP
* **Version:** Legacy release

### Impact

Outdated web services may allow attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities, gain unauthorized access, or extract sensitive data.

### Exploitability

* Multiple public exploits exist for legacy Apache versions
* Attack feasibility depends on enabled modules and configuration

### Recommendation

* Upgrade to a supported Apache version
* Remove unnecessary modules
* Apply secure configuration baselines

---

## Risk Context

The combination of remotely exploitable services and unrestricted internal access represents a **critical security risk**. In a real-world environment, these vulnerabilities could be leveraged to compromise the entire internal network.

---

## Conclusion

The vulnerabilities identified during this assessment highlight the importance of patch management, service hardening, and attack surface reduction. Immediate remediation of critical findings is required to prevent system compromise.
