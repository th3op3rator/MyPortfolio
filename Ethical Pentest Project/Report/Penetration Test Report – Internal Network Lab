## Executive Summary

An internal penetration test was conducted against a simulated small business network to evaluate the security posture of internal systems. The objective of this assessment was to identify exploitable vulnerabilities, determine the potential impact of a successful attack, and provide remediation recommendations to reduce organizational risk.

Testing revealed **critical vulnerabilities** stemming from outdated and misconfigured services. Most notably, an insecure FTP service allowed an unauthenticated attacker to gain **immediate root-level access**, resulting in full system compromise. If exploited in a real-world environment, these weaknesses could lead to data breaches, service disruption, and lateral movement across the internal network.

## 1. Scope & Authorization

### In-Scope Systems

* Metasploitable2 Linux Server
* Ubuntu Server (misconfigured services)
* Internal host-only network

### Out-of-Scope Systems

* Host operating system
* External networks
* Internet-facing infrastructure

### Authorization Statement

All testing was performed in a controlled lab environment using systems explicitly designed for vulnerability testing. No unauthorized systems were accessed.

---

## 2. Methodology

The penetration test followed a structured approach aligned with **NIST SP 800-115** and the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**:

1. Information Gathering & Reconnaissance
2. Scanning and Enumeration
3. Vulnerability Analysis
4. Exploitation
5. Post-Exploitation Impact Assessment
6. Remediation Recommendations

---

## 3. Reconnaissance & Enumeration

### Network Discovery

Multiple hosts were identified on the internal subnet using ARP-based discovery techniques.

### Port & Service Identification

Scanning identified numerous exposed services, including:

* FTP (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
* HTTP (Apache)
* SMB
* Remote management services

Several services were found to be outdated and lacked basic hardening controls.

---

## 4. Vulnerability Findings

### Finding 1: Backdoored FTP Service

* **Service:** vsFTPd 2.3.4
* **CVE:** CVE-2011-2523
* **Severity:** Critical
* **CVSS Score:** 10.0

#### Description

The FTP service running on the target system contained a known backdoor that allows remote attackers to gain shell access without authentication.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation resulted in **immediate root-level access**, granting full control of the operating system.

#### Evidence

* Successful remote shell
* `id` command confirmed UID 0 (root)

---

## 5. Exploitation Details

The identified FTP vulnerability was exploited using a publicly available Metasploit module. No authentication was required to execute the exploit.

Upon exploitation, a root shell was obtained, confirming a complete system compromise. No privilege escalation techniques were necessary, as the vulnerable service was running with elevated privileges.

---

## 6. Post-Exploitation Impact Analysis

With root access, an attacker could:

* Read and modify any system file
* Access credential hashes and sensitive configuration data
* Install persistent backdoors
* Pivot to additional internal systems
* Disable logging and monitoring controls

For ethical reasons, no destructive actions or persistence mechanisms were implemented.

---

## 7. Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor  | Assessment   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Likelihood   | High         |
| Impact       | Very High    |
| Overall Risk | **Critical** |

The presence of remotely exploitable services with root privileges represents an unacceptable level of risk in a production environment.

---

## 8. Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

* Remove or replace the vulnerable FTP service
* Patch all outdated software
* Restrict unnecessary network services

### Long-Term Improvements

* Enforce least-privilege service accounts
* Implement host-based firewalls
* Enable centralized logging and alerting
* Conduct regular vulnerability assessments

---

## 9. Validation & Retesting

Following remediation, a validation scan confirmed that:

* The vulnerable FTP service was no longer accessible
* Previously exposed ports were closed or restricted

This demonstrates that the recommended controls effectively reduced the attack surface.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The penetration test successfully demonstrated how outdated and misconfigured services can lead to rapid and complete system compromise. Addressing the identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security controls will significantly improve the organization’s internal security posture.

Regular testing, patch management, and adherence to security best practices are essential to reducing future risk.
